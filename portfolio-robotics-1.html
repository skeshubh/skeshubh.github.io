              <h2>Abstract</h2>
              <p>
                Path planning is the key aspect for performance of a mobile robot in any application. Creating a path around static
                 obstacles is achievable since decades but moving around dynamic obstacles that present themselves on the planned path is a major
                 challenge for modern applications in robotics. This project presents a solution combining sampling based algorithms AIT* &
                 BIT* for path planning and Model Predictive Control for obstacle avoidance, and compare them to the already existing solutions
                 in a virtual environment using simulation tools like RViz and Gazebo.
              </p>

              <h2>Methedology</h2>
              <p>
                I implemented advanced algorithms such as AIT* and BIT* for global path planning, combined with a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) 
                for local path optimization. As a baseline, I compared performance against standard APF + RRT planners. This enhanced approach led 
                to improved computational efficiency, reduced time complexity, and smoother navigation paths.
              </p>

              <h4>Batch Informed Trees (BIT*) Algorithm Overview</h4>
              <p>
                The key idea behind BIT* is to reduce the computational cost of RRT* by processing batches of nodes instead of one node at a time. 
                This allows BIT* to explore the configuration space more efficiently and converge to a solution faster than RRT*. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the cost updates and pruning steps help to maintain an efficient search tree that does not waste computational 
                resources exploring regions of the configuration space that are unlikely to lead to a solution.
              </p>
              <p> Here is a high-level overview of the BIT* algorithm:</p>
              <ol>
                <li> Initialize the search tree with the start node.</li>
                <li> Sample a batch of nodes from the configuration space. These nodes are called ”waypoints”.</li>
                <li> For each waypoint, attempt to connect it to the existing tree by finding the nearest node in the tree and creating a new 
                     edge between the waypoint and the nearest node.</li>
                <li> Once all the waypoints have been connected to the tree, perform a cost update for each node in the tree. The cost of a node 
                     is the sum of the costs of the edges that connect it to the root node.</li>
                <li> Prune the tree by removing any nodes whose cost is greater than a certain threshold.</li>
                <li> Repeat steps 2-5 until the goal is reached or a certain time limit is exceeded.</li>
                <li> If a path to the goal is found, return it. Otherwise, return failure.</li>
              </ol>
              <div>
                  <img src="assets/img/robotics1/fig3.png" class="testimonial-img" alt="Visualization of BIT* algorithm">

              <p></p>

              <h4>Adaptively Informed Trees (AIT*) Algorithm Overview</h4>
              <p>
                Adaptively Informed Trees (AIT*) is a sampling-based motion planning algorithm that blends the strengths of A* and RRT*, making it 
                well-suited for high-dimensional problems with multiple objectives. It intelligently biases its sampling based on a heuristic estimate 
                of the remaining cost to the goal, similar to A*, which helps guide the search more efficiently toward the goal configuration.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to goal-directed sampling, AIT* supports multi-objective optimization using a weighted sum approach, allowing users to 
                prioritize different cost components. It also introduces a cost-to-go estimation technique to better evaluate the efficiency of extending 
                paths, resulting in faster convergence and more effective exploration of the state space.
              </p>
              <p> Here is a high-level overview of the AIT* algorithm:</p>
              <ol>
                <li> Initialize a tree with the starting configuration as the root node.</li>
                <li> Sample a random configuration in the state space and find the closest node in the tree to it.</li>
                <li> Extend the tree towards the sampled configuration by generating a path from the closest node to the sampled configuration.</li>
                <li> Calculate the cost of the path based on the multiple objectives, such as minimizing distance, maximizing clearance, or minimizing time.</li>
                <li> Update the cost of all nodes along the path and rewire the tree to ensure optimality.</li>
                <li> Repeat steps 2 to 5 until the goal configuration is reached or a certain termination condition is met.</li>
                <li> If the goal configuration is reached, return the path from the root node to the goal configuration. Otherwise, return failure.</li>
              </ol>
              <div>
                  <img src="assets/img/robotics1/fig5.png" class="testimonial-img" alt="Visualization of AIT* algorithm">

              <h4>Non-Linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) Algorithm Overview</h4>
              <p>
                NMPC is a complex and computationally intensive control strategy that involves predicting the future behavior of the system, optimizing 
                control actions based on this prediction, and implementing the optimal actions over a finite prediction horizon.
              </p>
              <p>
                NMPC is an effective approach for controlling non-linear systems with time-varying dynamics and constraints, and it is widely used in 
                process control, robotics, and other advanced control applications.
              </p>
              <p>The following is a high-level algorithm overview of NMPC:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>System modeling: </b> Develop a mathematical model that describes the behavior of the system being controlled. This model should 
                    be nonlinear and time-varying, accounting for any nonlinearities and dynamics present in the system.</li>
                <li><b>Define control objectives: </b> Determine the control objectives, including the desired output and any constraints on the inputs
                    and outputs.</li>
                <li><b>Time horizon selection: </b> Select a time horizon over which to optimize the control actions. This time horizon is typically 
                  divided into a finite number of time intervals or ”prediction horizons”.</li>
                <li><b>Predict future system behavior: </b> Using the mathematical model, predict the future behavior of the system over the prediction
                  horizons.</li>
                <li><b>Optimization: </b> Determine the optimal control actions that achieve the desired output while satisfying the input and output 
                  constraints, based on the predicted behavior of the system.</li>
                <li><b>Implementation: </b> Implement the optimal control actions for the current time interval, and update the model and control 
                  strategy for the next time interval.</li>
                <li><b>Repeat: </b> Repeat steps 4-6 for each time interval in the prediction horizon, continuously updating the model and control 
                  strategy as needed.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Experimentation &amp; Results</h2>
              <p>
                To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed planner (AIT*, BIT* with MPC), we conducted experiments in both a simplified 2D 
                environment and a simulated warehouse setup. The robot was tasked with navigating from a user-defined start to goal point in a dynamic 
                environment containing moving obstacles like other robots and untracked warehouse items. As a baseline, we used the RRT + APF planner 
                and visualized path results using Matplotlib and Rviz. After testing in a toy 2D environment, we extended the simulation to Gazebo-based 
                warehouse layouts to better assess real-world applicability.
              </p>
              <p>
                We compared each planner using key performance metrics: percentage of dynamic obstacles detected, computational efficiency, energy consumption, 
                time taken, path smoothness, and accuracy of optimal traversal. In challenging scenarios with increased obstacle density, AIT* and BIT* 
                outperformed the baseline in terms of path optimization and fewer node explorations. Cost-to-go graphs showed that AIT* and BIT* efficiently 
                reduced path cost after initial discovery of the goal, unlike RRT which kept costs static until the goal was found. Additionally, BIT* and AIT* 
                required significantly fewer nodes to reach optimized paths, demonstrating better computational efficiency.

              <p>
                Despite their strengths, these planners have limitations. AIT* is more computationally demanding, while BIT* requires significant memory and 
                is sensitive to tuning parameters. The MPC component, though powerful, demands precise modeling and careful parameter adjustment, which can 
                be time-consuming. In rare cases, if optimization offers conflicting path choices in consecutive steps, it may cause the robot to deviate or 
                collide. Nonetheless, the proposed methods significantly advanced real-time path planning performance in dynamic, cluttered environments.
